<p> 
physics, science that deals with the structure of 
matter and the interactions between the fundamental 
constituents of the observable universe. In the 
broadest sense, physics (from the Greek physikos) is 
concerned with all aspects of nature on both the 
macroscopic and submicroscopic levels.

<h2> Newton's First Law of Motion: </h2>

<p> 
Newton’s first law states that if a body is at rest 
or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, 
it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight 
line at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a 
force.

Newton's first law of motion predicts the behavior of 
objects for which all existing forces are balanced. 
The first law - sometimes referred to as the law of 
inertia - states that if the forces acting upon an 
object are balanced, then the acceleration of that 
object will be 0 m/s/s. Newton's first law of motion predicts the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are balanced.

<h2> Newton's Third Law of Motion: </h2>

<p>
A force is a push or a pull that acts upon an object 
as a results of its interaction with another object. 
Forces result from interactions! As discussed in 
Lesson 2, some forces result from contact interactions 
(normal, frictional, tensional, and applied forces are 
examples of contact forces) and other forces are the 
result of action-at-a-distance interactions.
